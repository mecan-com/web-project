                 Sometimes it's better to go for the tried and tested instead of the new and unknown. Theo Parrish has carved his spot amongst
                  the great producers and DJs of the last 20 years. His production is unique and ever changing, which is part of the charm.
                  He often experiments to push his sound and techniques as far as possible. We present Sound Signature ‎– SS016, 2002.

                  Robert Crash has been silently making waves since his white label 'Mercenary EP' was put out in 2013. Recently, he's released three records on his own label, Dog In The Night Records.  On his Facebook page you can see him selling his personal TR-909 and SH-101, so it's clear where his influences originate. The first release on his label features a 5 track EP that contains "Thundering kicks, sick arrangement and a thumping bassline."

This 10" record on M>O>S Recordings features two psychedelic, retro-house cuts that lead as a solid introduction into the world of D'Marc Cantu.

                    Versalife, better known as Conforce, can be quoted saying things like, "i'm no dj, i just play music every now and then." He's one of those rare producers that makes it a point to distinguish himself from DJing in this never ending sea of good producer turned terrible DJ. Versalife's style steers towards darker synth pads overlying crisp drums from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mEepKCmjAk" class="art-post-link">AcidLab Miami</a>. His first album under Versalife, 'Vantage Point', has a clear emphasis on the low-end while maintaining his characteristic pads.

With the increased attention around Cloudface these days, UK label, Going Good, decided it was time to release a vinyl version after the initial limited tape run grew in demand. A listen through this 8 track release of lush, spaced out trips will have you coming back for more.

                    "The LP sees the producers leaving behind their signature styles — Function's steely brand of techno and Vatican Shadow's noisier fare — to explore ambient sounds. Apparently the record was put together in both New York and Berlin, with recording sessions taking place in the early hours of the morning. New York's skyline proved to be of particular inspiration—the pair have chosen a black and white image of the Empire State Building for the sleeve."

                    The distorted, hefty Kicks underlying Ekman's 5th solo EP of 2014 sets it apart from the usual batch of techno. Leaning on the experimental end of the spectrum, Ekman focuses on the subtleties of tracks composed of few individual parts. Towards the end, when all the elements are in play, Ekman seems to complete the perfect balance between kick, percussion, haunting chords, and trippy lead.

                    A classic instrumental tune off of the 'Megatron Man' album, based on the theme song from the TV series 'Sea Hunt' (1958-1961). The track has a more balearic feel than Cowley's HI-NRG productions, but his mastery of the synths is still front and centre. Although rhythmically hypnotic and pulsating, the music maintains a sense of adventure, very much akin to exploring oceanic depths.

                    Inconspicuous Montreal talent, James-Lawrence, reveals glimpses of his unreleased portfolio to the public for the first time ever through 3 hand-picked selections. Each track is distinctly different from the next while staying recognizable to his overall theme. James-Lawrence has an ability to perfectly blend fast paced percussion with strung out guitar notes. J a m e s - L a w r e n c e. <- Keep an eye out.

                    Berlin trio, FJAAK, releases their first record on 50Weapons with a two sided banger. The two tracks are in the same vein as René Pawlowitz (Shed, Head High, Wax, WK7, etc) -- heavy drums and momentous synth hooks. The A side features a poppier house-influenced track while the B side takes it a bit darker and discards any distracting vocals.

                    Few artists have an ear for hooks like Joy O & Boddika. This yet to be relased track has been confirmed by Joy O that it is indeed his own production (rumoured Kassem Mosse, orginally). "This one below is actually a demo by Boddika & me, out in the new year as part of something special we've been planning".

With his track 'Royal Dilemma' from his 'Karmatic Equations' EP sounding eerly similar to Theo Parrish's EP from 1999, 'Overyohead', the wonderkid brings his first three releases to Sound Signature, Wild Oats, and Apron Records.

                    L'estasi Dell'oro presents himself in a mysterious way. His releases float around vague points of techno and forlorn emotions that bundle together into dramatic EPs. This one is no exception, as long pads under rhythmic piano and heavy hihats obscure a broadcasted female vocal. Take a 10 minute trip to find out what he's all about.

Reminiscent of Amon Tobin, with a heavier lean towards techno.

                    Three Chairs is a production project established by three key figures in the Detroit house and techno community: Theo Parrish, Kenny Dixon, Jr. (AKA Moodymann) and Rick Wilhite, with Marcellus Pittmann and Norma Jean Bell contributing more recently. It's hard to find any second-rate tracks by these masters, so it's no surprise that their collaberative work is astounding.

                    'Bitter Sweet' combines a heavy beat with an elegant keyboard riff like no other track. This slow paced track makes for easy listening and serious enjoyment. What's most impressive about is the lead synth that comes in half way. Reminiscent of a simple Levon Vincent song, 'Bitter Sweet' stands as one of Scott Groove's best releases. We highly recommend checking his releases from the 90's.

                    Kareem Moser, aka Kassem Mosse, brings in Omnira with a track that probably contains only 5 distinct elements. Everything is built around the powerful synth, as per usual with Kassem Mosse productions. The B1, by Juniper, features a more upbeat track that may be prefered to the Kassem Mosse track. For vinyl buyers, this record just got another repress in 2014 since the prices were reaching absurd amounts once again. Atlhough, if you're reading this, it's probably too late to get it for a fair price.

                    Simple, short, and effective can only describe the A2 on this LIES record. In fact, the entire record is quite simple in terms of production, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth a listen. It's the perfect blend of hip-hop type percussion and a slow beat. The other 3 tracks on this record are equally as good, if not better. Highly recommened checking out the entire B side, 'Speechless Tape' and 'I Don't Have A Soul'.

Something about the sounds and vibes of his music makes for an extremely distinct sound. Inimeg Recordings was founded by Joey Anderson and features releases by himself and close friends. If you're looking for laid back, kaleidoscopic, and emotive music you should check this out.

                    The third release on The Monkey Bar Records brings in 3 new artists, Eduardo De La Calle, 333, and Marco Shuttle. Marco Shuttle is best known for his relases <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9vqc399EbY" class="musicLink">>'Sing Like A Bird'</a>, which combines trippy techno with an equivalent female vocal. This release keeps in style with the previous 2 in the way that it's, once again, vinyl only, grey marbled, 300 only. Arguably the most complete Monkey Bar, with two standout tracks by Eduardo De La Calle and Marco Shuttle.

In fact, all three tracks on this EP are above par. It's hard to describe the A side since there's nothing that sounds quite like it. This track is definitely perfect for a hazed mind trip. The 1/16th claps in this bring the tension up, but overall this track is nothing but breezy.

                    Let's take a trip back to 1993 when the electronic classic, 'B12 ‎– Electro-Soma', was released. Although many of the tracks on this album were released previously in 1991 and 1992, it's still a memorable, cohesive album. The two standout tracks, 'Metropolis' and 'Debris', offer a look into 1993 production. What's so special about this release is that if the date wasn't mentioned one would have no idea it was released almost 23 years old.

                    A fair warning to those going to listen to this record: this is not for the faint of heart. To ease you in, we have linked to the B side, which features a remix by Transportation AAD. It's not quite on the same level as the A-side, but is still very, very pleasureable to listen to. The spooky pads and more straightforward approach makes it more accesible and enjoyable to some. If you like the remix, check out the original that is linked. Be wary of the price, as this record is marketed as "300 Copies Only / Never To Be Repressed Again / 180g Vinyl". (If you're not a fan after listening to 3:20min onwards...)

                    What can be said about the Romanian producer Petre Inspriescu that hasn't already been said. He's easily one of the most talented and abstract producers in the underground music scene. With two beautiful albums to his name, he's established himself as one of the top minimal producers around. Nervmusic Records has catalogue of vinyl only releases featuring painted artwork and artists obssessed with sound.  For this release, they commissioned Petre Inspirescu to do a remix of a Laurine Frost's 'Let's Feed The Wolf'. The remix spans 15 minutes, nothing too out of the ordinary for Petre Inspirescu, and features lots of unique acoustic sounds behind repeating beat. This is probably one of his lesser known works, which is why we'd like to share it.

                    Sometimes you don't need more than a simple house beat and a catchy piano riff. The clear standouts here are the 7 piano notes followed by a deep heavy bass note. For the curious, 'Real Dubz' is a collaboration project from native Berliner Graef & globe trotter aka Fanstastic Man. The flipside of this record is a classic house track with powerful synth stabs and played down piano. An appregaited synth riff with a ride cymbal gives the B side a more hectic feeling.

                This is among the best analogue music I can think of - it has it all. The percussion is on point with perfect snare drum hits intertwined with fast moving hihats that. On top of that, you get the relaxed synths in the back that keep the song moving along. As the progression of Route8's 'Waving Goodbye' continues a distinct bassline gets brought in that elevates low end of the groove. Even after all that, at 2:33min, the simplest sci-fi sounding notes come in to complete the track. If you're a fan of this selection, you have to check out all his productions.

                Deemonlover makes a splash in saturated waters with his two new releases on Bliq. His unique style blends everything that's hitting the charts right now and more. The latest release, 'Deemonlover ‎– Choronzon' [Bliq 10], features a remix by XDB to help propel the record to a wider audience. Hopefully this exposure will rub-off onto Deemonlover -- the music is there, all that is needed is the accumulated exposure. His older release, 'Deemonlover ‎– Manticore' [Bliq 9], featues 4 diverse tracks that are still distinctly held together by a common thread; maybe it's the subtle intros or the enduring pads. Take a listen for yourself and decide.

                Vril makes his mark on the German label Giegling through his four releases. He doesn't venture far past the dark dubby techno sound, which has allowed him to perfect his craft. The current 3 part series, numbered '1-4', '5-7', and 8-10', starts out  punchier and becomes more ambient as the series progresses. Fans of dub-techno should check out all 3 parts, but if you had to only listen to one, go for '8-10'.

                Head Front Panel is a newly inaugurated label that stems from their parent label Tabernacle Records. Upon first listen of their catalogue one may get the impression that these tracks are over the top or just too ecletic. A key formula to their success is exactly what may drive some people away from this label - they don't give a fuck. The music throughout Head Front Panel is raw, with banging percussion, bleeping acid notes, and techno synth stabs. The most appealing tracks offer a unique synth hook that overshadow any faults in the tracks. Overall, many of the tracks are hit or miss, but the ones that hit are destined to make an impression. Releasing only 150 records per EP means these tracks will only be in the hands of a select few DJs that have the ability to play something different. The standout tracks include HFP#001 A1 Untitled, HFP#003 A2 Untitled, HFP#003 A1 Untitled, and HP#004 A Untitled. Take a listen to the synths at 5:23min followed by a crazy acid line and you'll know what we mean.

                    There isn't much information on this label, which is something people may find extremely appealing. The A side of 'CVBox ‎– Le Box Dd' provides 3 short techno cuts whereas the B side is a single groove from start to finish. What really stands out is the percussion and repeated synth on the B side. The compressed, lo-fi percussion litters the B side while a bubbly synth keeps the listener occupied. This is definitely a versatile EP that starts off the Lunatic label on a strong note.

                        With the first release on this label selling at exorbitant rates, it's no surprise that their second EP is quality. The production is quite simple; it's only a Waldorf Q and Roland TR-909. The simplicity lends to their benefit in this case. All the sounds in this release are already familiar to most techno heads, which gives an instant recoginition to the two tracks. This release is nothing revolutionary, per se, but it doesn't have to be. Both sides offer superb tracks to the point that it's hard to say which is better.

                        The first run of a vinly only limited series on Delft, catalogued Delft 00x, brings a new twist on an old classic. Produced by La-4a, one could argue these are some of the best acid tracks produced in 2014. This record features 3 tracks of spaced out acid with well placed vocal samples. On the B side, 'Americakid' offers a plastikman-esque acid line that gradually modulates throughout the 6 minutes and 49 seconds. Invader is a dance floor stomper that will leave an impression to any listener.
