                                an ancient sound of the earth, of life itself"

                        Most men had forgotten about the King property on the south bank of the Wolf
                        River, halfway between Rossville and Piperton. The land was overgrown with vine
                        and bushes, and the steel gate on the country road was rusted beyond repair. The
                        path that led up the hill from the waterfront had long since been overrun, and was
                        not easily traversed. Atop the hill stood the old house with the thick timber walls and
                        the tall windows overlooking the water. The Wolf River flows slowly through
                        Tennessee, and its winding curves make for a pleasant and unchallenging course. It’s
                        said that the local Indian tribe, the Chickasaw, used to travel from village to village
                        on a calm day without paddling their canoes, drifting down the stream like leaves on
                        a lazy wind. The spring-fed Nashoba, as the Chickasaw called it, is no more. In its
                        place sits the Wolf, silted and contaminated. Eroding banks and sanded bogs now
                        littered the shore, the bright sounds of yesteryear long since faded into eerie quiet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        The dead branches on the ground crumpled underfoot as Michael stepped out of the
                        dinghy. The dock swayed in the current as he tied the boat in place and slung the
                        canvas bag over his shoulder. Standing tall, he spat into the murky depths and
                        stepped onto the shore of the small pebble beach. Aside from the bag and the
                        machete sheathed at his waist, Michael had brought little with him. He wore a
                        cotton shirt that hung loose at the neck and a pair of old infantry pants tucked into
                        wool socks. With the tip of his boot, he scraped through the long grass, pushing
                        aside dry leaves until he found the rocks hidden underneath. The bushes, once kept
                        trim by his brothers at his father’s behest, had grown wild and tangled, their leafy
                        branches intertwined, obscuring the graveled path.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        Michael dropped his bag to the ground and took to the brush on the hill with the
                        machete. He pushed methodically upwards; sweat dripping from his arms into the
                        soil. The blade was sharp, and struck quickly through the wood and leaves. He was
                        halfway up the hill as the sun began to fall beneath the trees on the river’s opposite
                        bank. The sunlight flickered and reflected off the windows up above, the glare
                        reflecting in his eyes. Cutting through the last of the overgrowth, Michael stepped
                        from the path onto the well-worn wrap-around patio. As he turned towards the
                        water, the sun finally settled across the shore. The Wolf River grew dark, but the
                        constant whispering of the current remained.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        There had once stood a cabin on the land, small but sturdy, almost a hundred years
                        ago. Now, in its place stood a grand old home, built by Michael’s grandfather
                        Marlon after his war. The front of the house was built facing the river, and was
                        perched precariously over the side of the steep slope where the path led down to the
                        dock. The porch was dotted with wrought iron benches, where Michael and his
                        brothers used to sleep on hot summer days. When he was young, their home had
                        been the pride of the county, but now it was grey and rot with age. Every door had
                        been bolted shut from the inside, save the one overlooking the lake. Michael laid his
                        bag at his feet and patted down his jacket pockets before finding the iron key hung
                        on a cord of twine. He had received it in the barracks post in ‘43, attached with a
                        form letter from the bank, explaining that the house was his property now. He hadn’t
                        understood until he received the letter from his cousins in Rossville the next day.
                        Though the escutcheon had long since rusted, the lock held true, and the key slid
                        easily into place. Michael heard the grinding of the unused gears, and pushed the
                        door unstuck into the living room. No one had set foot in the house in eleven years,
                        and the floors were choked with dust. As he walked past the fireplace, Michael
                        dropped his bag on the wide dining table and stepped into the kitchen.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        He remembered his brother Robert taking him on a walk towards town when they
                        had been only five and seven years old; they had cut through the wheat field across
                        the road, and trucked through a shallow pond just north of the Twin Lakes. As they
                        came down the gentle slope onto the McInnes farm, they had seen the old man and
                        his wife out in the orchard, and had offered their hands, picking the low hanging
                        fruit near until sunset. They had left with wide smiles, sore arms and a small hemp
                        sack of apples given in thanks. Walking back, Robert got the idea to cut the apples
                        and ask their Ma to bake a pie. When they climbed the steps and walked through the
                        back door, their father was sitting in his favourite chair smoking from a small <i>bruyere</i>
                        pipe. The chair was old and worn, but he loved it well, as it had been his father’s.

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        Their father hardly lifted his head from his book as the boys made way to the kitchen
                        and Robert drew a long sharp knife from the block. He stepped onto the stool, and
                        as the pipe smoke floated above their heads, began to slice the apples methodically.
                        All of a sudden, he hollered like a beast, and the knife slipped from his hand and fell
                        and stuck in the floor inches from Michael’s feet. There was blood everywhere, and
                        the screams woke the baby and Ma yelled from upstairs, but before the panic truly
                        took hold, their father was there with his clasped iron box. The case was well
                        polished, with silver latches, a thick leather handle and the arms of the U.S Army
                        emblazoned across its front. It clicked open, and their father removed a small tin
                        sewing kit and several pads of gauze. He was calm, and his lips were taut under his
                        thick red beard as he told Michael to hold the gauze to the wound and told their Ma
                        to stay upstairs with the baby. The cut was deep, Michael could see that much, and
                        the pale white bone of Robert’s thumb was visible halfway between the knuckle and
                        wrist.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        His father’s hands were steady, never faltering, threading the needle back and forth
                        through the flesh of his brother’s hand. Robert was crying, trying to stifle his sobs by
                        clenching his teeth as the stitches brought sinew and skin together. Their father’s
                        concentration never wavered, his pale green eyes set solely on the task at hand. He
                        didn’t speak other than to ask for gauze or thread, and for a moment, Michael felt as
                        if he were standing by his father’s operating table in town. By the time they were
                        done, Robert’s tears had dried. Their father reminded them that they were too young
                        to handle knives, and called down their Ma to dote on the patient. She did, and had
                        kisses for Michael and Robert both. She had made them throw away the apples,
                        which had been sprayed with blood, but she promised to buy more.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        Michael stood and slowly walked towards the basement door in the northwest corner
                        of the house. As he did, the floorboards moved and creaked beneath him, the dust
                        jumping and settling with every step. It was then that he heard the howling whistle
                        through the cracks in the walls, carried adrift over the river from up in the hills.
                        Quickly, he rushed to the door, and opened it to swallow the sound. It was beautiful,
                        he thought, to hear as the wolves joined each other from miles away. The moon was
                        crisp and white, only a sliver away from full, its light hanging soft on the trees like
                        snow. Every howl was followed by another and as each joined the baleful orchestra
                        grew stronger. The Nashoba was alive with the night as the moonlight played off its
                        surface, like a projection in a cinema, with the wolves as a beautiful accompaniment.
                        Each voice was different than the one before it as they cried out to their brothers and
                        sisters from miles away. Suddenly, the song began to fade and the voices dropped off
                        one at a time, as Michael stood silent, shivering from the cold.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        Stepping back inside, he climbed down the basement stairs and opened the cellar
                        door. He stood before the large antique cabinet with wound metal handles and
                        fumbled in his pockets for the key he had found in his father’s safety deposit box in
                        Rossville. It was small and silver and it bore his grandfather’s initials engraved in
                        block letters. As he moved to turn the lock the door gently swung open on its own,
                        revealing the collected armaments of four generations of the King family. That the
                        door was unlocked was worrisome, but to his relief all the weapons were accounted
                        for. On the far left was the Enfield rifle laid down by his great-uncle William at the
                        skirmish at Moscow. Next were his grandfather’s three hunting rifles, with which
                        Michael, his brothers and his father were all taught to shoot, firing at cans perched
                        on a dock out on the river. His uncle’s Lee-Enfield, which his father had bought
                        back after the Great War, reddened with rust, hung next to a leather holster with his
                        father’s pistol.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        Their father had first killed a man in the Belleau Wood, though he had rarely spoken
                        of it. He had been reassigned from his battalion to the Marines, and followed
                        Sergeant Daly’s group as a medic on the first charge through the field. Sixteen men
                        were dead in the blink of an eye as the machine guns tore through their ranks, their
                        bodies disappearing beneath the waist-high wheat. His father had been lucky, and
                        had time enough to drop flat to the ground. Crawling on hands and knees, hidden to
                        the enemy, he could find no sign of life in any of his men as the second wave charged
                        the enemy encampment. He heard someone shout for a medic from the nearby
                        wood, and had run to help. The man was an officer, and badly wounded, blood
                        seeping through the front of his shirt. His father had reached for his kit, but before
                        he could open it, a shot rang out and the officer’s chest burst open in a splash of
                        bright red. He turned to see a German soldier advancing slowly, rifle in hand. Their
                        father had always insisted that he had “only done what was necessary” that day,
                        sparing the details until Michael and his brothers were old enough. He had feigned
                        surrender, but when the German stepped closer to take his gun, he swept the man’s
                        legs out from under him. They had wrestled in the mud, tearing at each other
                        blindly. In the end Michael’s father had prevailed, and had drawn the German’s own
                        dagger and sunk it in his throat.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        Michael took the pistol, climbed the stairs and stepped through the back door into
                        the yard behind the house. Even in the dim light, he could make out the trees several
                        yards away. The woods had seemed infinite when he was a boy, climbing over fallen
                        trunks and through the thicket at dusk. It was an old oak forest, and the ground was
                        thick all year round with dried leaves and twigs that crackled underfoot. He had only
                        ever been lost once in those woods as a young boy, though he had not been scared. It
                        had been so quiet and peaceful. Robert and Patrick had found him hours later,
                        sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall birch tree, eyes closed, a smile hanging on
                        his lips.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        Michael stuck to the edge of the forest and collected birch bark and kindling. Passing
                        the old wooden storehouse in the yard, he strode back towards the door of the house.
                        He lit a match, and lay it gently under the birch in the small stone fireplace until the
                        bark began to smoke and crisp. Adding the kindling and the logs, the flames spit and
                        crackled, the heat creeping into Michael’s bones and bright yellow light flickering
                        throughout the room. Once again, the house felt like home, and Michael could
                        almost hear his Ma yelling at Patrick to finish his chores or calling the boys down for
                        dinner. He remembered the sound of Patrick’s shouts when he caught his first trout,
                        and their father’s laughter, and Robert smiling when he got his AGCT results in ’39.
                        He was old now, Michael realized, and his brothers were gone, and here he was on
                        the old sofa in their house, burning the old wood and staring down at the same old
                        river. The fire wavered, reflecting in Michael’s eyes as his eyelids begun to shut. He
                        felt the day and the night and the day before it in his bones. The heat softly cradled
                        him against the pillows and he slept, the way a man can only sleep when he feels at
                        home.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        The howl carved through the silence and Michael woke with a start. The embers
                        were fading, and he shivered in the early morning cold. The light filtered through
                        the trees and dew collected on the windowpane as he rose with the fur blanket
                        draped around his shoulders. He wiped the sleep from his eyes and walked out onto
                        the porch into the dawn. He thought it queer that the wolves were howling now,
                        with the night long since faded into day. The howl sounded again, and reverberated
                        against the shore, along the river and through the trees, but there was no answer. It
                        was a lone mournful wail, a pup looking for its pack. Michael turned and stepped
                        back inside, leaving the door ajar to let the wind whistle in with the fresh country air.
                        The wolf must have gotten lost. He hoped that its brothers were looking for it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="writing-paragraph">
                        The fire’s embers had turned to charcoal and the house was dark, as the sun had not
                        yet fully risen from behind the trees on the opposite bank. He opened the first
                        drawer nearest the back door in the kitchen, and pulled out an old wooden box.
                        Sitting down at the chair near the window, he set the box on his lap and opened it.
                        The seat creaked, and the well-worn cushions spat up dust as he settled in. Michael
                        sat back in his grandfather’s chair and loaded a single round from the box into the
                        chamber of his father’s pistol, and stared out at the calm waters of the Wolf River as
                        the sun rose above the trees and the last howl of the lone wolf rang out across the
                        dawn.

                                Seeing in her something of a country girl—though most especially when she tells me candidly that life is
                                not sane living simply with our memories—I look past the salient superficialities of her social
                                associations, an act by which I look quite deeply into the very social associations from which I wish to
                                have her separated. Conversely, that I emphasize that I see in her the quaintness and fortitude
                                characteristic of the country girl suggests that I might see in her little else. Whether this is of any
                                consequence is chiefly beyond any of my immediate concerns, unless, of course, there is uncontested
                                evidence that I actually do see little else in her apart from her vaguely traditional Southern qualities,
                                which I by all means do intend to conflate with country-like qualities mentioned above, if only to satiate
                                the palate of the general reader whom it is likely would not even have noticed the leap from “country”
                                to “traditional Southern.” However, considering her social context—unfortunately—does not suffice to
                                eclipse the subject of her filial context. It follows then that her Southernness is unquestionably
                                unquestionable, albeit uniquely and rightly beside the point: Seeing in her something of a country girl
                                bears no consequence unless I, like a sort of graceless literary Private I, attempt to understand her
                                history, the majority from which I had the grave unluck of being, quite simply, removed.

                                While to this day I have not met her mother, I twice met her father: once, oddly, on my
                                twentieth birthday; again on another occasion shortly thereafter. If not to Appease her by meeting her
                                father and stepmother (and their new daughter, whom they adopted from Cambodia—who now seems
                                even more peripheral than she did on my twentieth birthday, so much so I had to chalk out another one
                                of my endless yet predictable parentheticals just to have enough dramatic room for her), I can’t quite
                                remember anymore what exactly compelled me to drive out to the edge of Fulton county on my
                                twentieth birthday (which, for me, marked a sort of expulsion into adulthood, an escape from the
                                placenta-warmth of family life, the purpose of which currently consumes—menacingly—my mind’s
                                mechanisms, despite its essentially tacit knowledge that all such explorations are and will always be
                                arbitrarily (juvenilely, facetiously) Lacanian... please pardon the digression). What I had heard up to that
                                point about her father and her family’s history had not seemed to me especially enticing or warm (two
                                characteristics which I would later realize I had taken for granted in my own family, a misfortune which
                                is likely attributable to my propensity of looking into the relations within the families of others without
                                keeping in mind my own predispositions), especially when I, as we neared Milton<sup>1</sup>
                                , mentally
                                underscored those facts (in an exhausting and unrelenting type of way), and thoughtlessly forgot what
                                was bringing me there in the first damn place. I should add that up to that point I had never been to
                                Milton, and that the way she spoke about it made it seem to me a place for which I needed to foster
                                some superficial type of fondness, as if her having descended from the affluent suburb supplemented
                                her archetypal Southern qualities. To advance that notion, the way she spoke about nearly everything
                                (besides, of course, sorority life) seemed to germinate within me—inexplicably—new fondnesses.

                                Her father was a short oafish man with a tastefully painful-to-watch smile. I suppose his eyes,
                                which were the only physical characteristic he shared with her, were all that made the smile tolerable.
                                During our first handshake, I can remember, I looked down on him: literally, given that I stand, obtusely
                                hunched, around six feet tall; and emotionally, for my contempt for this man was writhing, pulsing with
                                anarchic youthfulness... You see, reader, I cannot quite entirely divulge what I learned of her father
                                before I met him. It would be in a fit of Real infidelity that I made public the things she confided in me
                                and thus in herself. Of course, though, my reader, you are here for something to read, and so I will give
                                it to you: After I met him, and after I had moved away (for good), I learned that her father had—quite
                                ceremoniously—excommunicated her from his life, backwardly citing the stepmother and new-daughter
                                as ample replacements for the daughter he never deserved to begin with. In truth, dear reader, I often
                                imagine him, fake-smiling, making that phone call to his daughter just to cast her into utter
                                estrangement, all the while intendedly oblivious to the replacement family he keeps around, like a
                                musician with old manuscripts.

                                His old manuscripts, fresh flesh though they may be, sit idly now in his new life, in which they
                            are merely pawns (and this, by his standards, is generous) to the end of his meaningless morose; in
                            which they have become faceless fixations of his malevolent malaise, subject indefinitely to his pitiful
                            and infantile whims; in which their fleeting use was used ultimately without Use. Having a humanist
                            heart, I weep for them as I cheer for her, now that she is one step nearer her own expulsion into
                            adulthood, the conclusivity of which I can only speculate as having nearly achieved full extrication from
                            that eyeful of oaf, her father.

                            other short end of what Buddy Glass claimed was the tendency of the writer “to give the reader, whom
                            we’ve never met, either the short end or the benefit of the doubt—the short end when we don’t credit
                            him with knowing as much about men and mores as we do, the benefit when we prefer not to believe
                            that he has the same kind of petty, sophisticated data at his fingertips that we have”<sup>3</sup>—an epiphanous
                            ésprit de l’escalier which is indeed naturally epiphanous in several ways, though this claim might force
                            one to think contrarily, to consider that perhaps an experience of <i>l’ésprit de l’escalier</i> does not occur
                            strictly to l’homme sensible,<sup>4</sup> but to all humans, those creatures overwhelmed not by the arguments
                            leveled against them, but rather by their own leveling against existence, against finitude, and against
                            temporality

                            —Trust me, friend, when I say that I loathe speaking in analogical and allegorical terms. At first I
                            was rather immune to bringing up, for example, Plato, but recently I realized that the circumstances at
                            his deathbed were repeated in those of “Papa” Monzano’s.<sup>5</sup> And, perhaps, when I bring this up it is not
                            to speak in analogical terms (since, after all, I’m not here to relegate a fantastical connection between Vonnegut’s politico-prosaic prowess and Plato’s intentionally (thoughtfully) ironic wishes), but, much
                            more than that, to emphasize the inevitable bouts of <i>l’ésprit de l’escalier</i> which we all too often take for
                            granted as simply missed opportunities (missed chances, missed glances), and which her father will
                            never exploit so as to gain remission of his sins.

                            2 <i>L'ésprit de l'escalier</i> (sometimes referred to in English as “staircase wit”) is the strange feeling of regret or defeat one experiences when they have thought of something too late for it to be of any use. </br></br>

                            5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstances of Plato’s death are, naturally, subject to some speculation. However, it seems common enough an anecdote that he requested that a Thracian girl play a measure for him on the flute, notably the instrument he banned in the eponymous entity in his work <i>The Republic</i>. In a similar fashion, the leader of Vonnegut’s fictional island-nation San Lorenzo, “Papa” Monzano, requests the religious last rites of the island’s one forbidden religion, Bokononism.
