                                Seeing in her something of a country girl—though most especially when she tells me candidly that life is
                                not sane living simply with our memories—I look past the salient superficialities of her social
                                associations, an act by which I look quite deeply into the very social associations from which I wish to
                                have her separated. Conversely, that I emphasize that I see in her the quaintness and fortitude
                                characteristic of the country girl suggests that I might see in her little else. Whether this is of any
                                consequence is chiefly beyond any of my immediate concerns, unless, of course, there is uncontested
                                evidence that I actually do see little else in her apart from her vaguely traditional Southern qualities,
                                which I by all means do intend to conflate with country-like qualities mentioned above, if only to satiate
                                the palate of the general reader whom it is likely would not even have noticed the leap from “country”
                                to “traditional Southern.” However, considering her social context—unfortunately—does not suffice to
                                eclipse the subject of her filial context. It follows then that her Southernness is unquestionably
                                unquestionable, albeit uniquely and rightly beside the point: Seeing in her something of a country girl
                                bears no consequence unless I, like a sort of graceless literary Private I, attempt to understand her
                                history, the majority from which I had the grave unluck of being, quite simply, removed.

                                While to this day I have not met her mother, I twice met her father: once, oddly, on my
                                twentieth birthday; again on another occasion shortly thereafter. If not to Appease her by meeting her
                                father and stepmother (and their new daughter, whom they adopted from Cambodia—who now seems
                                even more peripheral than she did on my twentieth birthday, so much so I had to chalk out another one
                                of my endless yet predictable parentheticals just to have enough dramatic room for her), I can’t quite
                                remember anymore what exactly compelled me to drive out to the edge of Fulton county on my
                                twentieth birthday (which, for me, marked a sort of expulsion into adulthood, an escape from the
                                placenta-warmth of family life, the purpose of which currently consumes—menacingly—my mind’s
                                mechanisms, despite its essentially tacit knowledge that all such explorations are and will always be
                                arbitrarily (juvenilely, facetiously) Lacanian... please pardon the digression). What I had heard up to that
                                point about her father and her family’s history had not seemed to me especially enticing or warm (two
                                characteristics which I would later realize I had taken for granted in my own family, a misfortune which
                                is likely attributable to my propensity of looking into the relations within the families of others without
                                keeping in mind my own predispositions), especially when I, as we neared Milton<sup>1</sup>
                                , mentally
                                underscored those facts (in an exhausting and unrelenting type of way), and thoughtlessly forgot what
                                was bringing me there in the first damn place. I should add that up to that point I had never been to
                                Milton, and that the way she spoke about it made it seem to me a place for which I needed to foster
                                some superficial type of fondness, as if her having descended from the affluent suburb supplemented
                                her archetypal Southern qualities. To advance that notion, the way she spoke about nearly everything
                                (besides, of course, sorority life) seemed to germinate within me—inexplicably—new fondnesses.

                                Her father was a short oafish man with a tastefully painful-to-watch smile. I suppose his eyes,
                                which were the only physical characteristic he shared with her, were all that made the smile tolerable.
                                During our first handshake, I can remember, I looked down on him: literally, given that I stand, obtusely
                                hunched, around six feet tall; and emotionally, for my contempt for this man was writhing, pulsing with
                                anarchic youthfulness... You see, reader, I cannot quite entirely divulge what I learned of her father
                                before I met him. It would be in a fit of Real infidelity that I made public the things she confided in me
                                and thus in herself. Of course, though, my reader, you are here for something to read, and so I will give
                                it to you: After I met him, and after I had moved away (for good), I learned that her father had—quite
                                ceremoniously—excommunicated her from his life, backwardly citing the stepmother and new-daughter
                                as ample replacements for the daughter he never deserved to begin with. In truth, dear reader, I often
                                imagine him, fake-smiling, making that phone call to his daughter just to cast her into utter
                                estrangement, all the while intendedly oblivious to the replacement family he keeps around, like a
                                musician with old manuscripts.

                                His old manuscripts, fresh flesh though they may be, sit idly now in his new life, in which they
                            are merely pawns (and this, by his standards, is generous) to the end of his meaningless morose; in
                            which they have become faceless fixations of his malevolent malaise, subject indefinitely to his pitiful
                            and infantile whims; in which their fleeting use was used ultimately without Use. Having a humanist
                            heart, I weep for them as I cheer for her, now that she is one step nearer her own expulsion into
                            adulthood, the conclusivity of which I can only speculate as having nearly achieved full extrication from
                            that eyeful of oaf, her father.

                            assuredly momentarily offend my readers by making my best decision concerning the defalcation of that
                            other short end of what Buddy Glass claimed was the tendency of the writer “to give the reader, whom
                            we’ve never met, either the short end or the benefit of the doubt—the short end when we don’t credit
                            him with knowing as much about men and mores as we do, the benefit when we prefer not to believe
                            that he has the same kind of petty, sophisticated data at his fingertips that we have”<sup>3</sup>—an epiphanous
                            ésprit de l’escalier which is indeed naturally epiphanous in several ways, though this claim might force
                            one to think contrarily, to consider that perhaps an experience of <i>l’ésprit de l’escalier</i> does not occur
                            strictly to l’homme sensible,<sup>4</sup> but to all humans, those creatures overwhelmed not by the arguments
                            leveled against them, but rather by their own leveling against existence, against finitude, and against

                            —Trust me, friend, when I say that I loathe speaking in analogical and allegorical terms. At first I
                            was rather immune to bringing up, for example, Plato, but recently I realized that the circumstances at
                            his deathbed were repeated in those of “Papa” Monzano’s.<sup>5</sup> And, perhaps, when I bring this up it is not
                            to speak in analogical terms (since, after all, I’m not here to relegate a fantastical connection between Vonnegut’s politico-prosaic prowess and Plato’s intentionally (thoughtfully) ironic wishes), but, much
                            more than that, to emphasize the inevitable bouts of <i>l’ésprit de l’escalier</i> which we all too often take for
                            granted as simply missed opportunities (missed chances, missed glances), and which her father will
                            never exploit so as to gain remission of his sins.

                            2 <i>L'ésprit de l'escalier</i> (sometimes referred to in English as “staircase wit”) is the strange feeling of regret or defeat one experiences when they have thought of something too late for it to be of any use. </br></br>

                            5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstances of Plato’s death are, naturally, subject to some speculation. However, it seems common enough an anecdote that he requested that a Thracian girl play a measure for him on the flute, notably the instrument he banned in the eponymous entity in his work <i>The Republic</i>. In a similar fashion, the leader of Vonnegut’s fictional island-nation San Lorenzo, “Papa” Monzano, requests the religious last rites of the island’s one forbidden religion, Bokononism.
