                        Graduating from <i>l'&Eacutecole des Arts DÃ©coratifs de Strasbourg</i> in 2011, Marion Fayolle has  been active in France illustrating comics, co-founding and running the magazine Nyctalope, and even being commissioned by The New York Times as an illustrator.  <i>In Pieces</i>  is the first of her collections to be published in English, and we are very happy to be able to share her works with you.  <i>In Pieces</i> is visual poetry, with each series of illustration taking up one to two pages.  Each series of illustrations are a display of human relationships â sometimes dark, sometimes philosophical, sometimes light, but always comical.  We hope you enjoy this selection of illustrations from Marion Fayolleâs book, In Pieces.

                            Most men had forgotten about the King property on the south bank of the Wolf 
                            River, halfway between Rossville and Piperton. The land was overgrown with vine 
                            and bushes, and the steel gate on the country road was rusted beyond repair. The 
                            path that led up the hill from the waterfront had long since been overrun, and was 
                            not easily traversed. Atop the hill stood the old house with the thick timber walls and 
                            the tall windows overlooking the water. The Wolf River flows slowly through 
                            Tennessee, and its winding curves make for a pleasant and unchallenging course. Itâs 
                            said that the local Indian tribe, the Chickasaw, used to travel from village to village 
                            on a calm day without paddling their canoes, drifting down the stream like leaves on 
                            a lazy wind. The spring-fed Nashoba, as the Chickasaw called it, is no more. In its 
                            place sits the Wolf, silted and contaminated. Eroding banks and sanded bogs now 
                            littered the shore, the bright sounds of yesteryear long since faded into eerie quiet.

                            dinghy. The dock swayed in the current as he tied the boat in place and slung the
                            canvas bag over his shoulder. Standing tall, he spat into the murky depths and 
                            stepped onto the shore of the small pebble beach. Aside from the bag and the 
                            machete sheathed at his waist, Michael had brought little with him. He wore a 
                            cotton shirt that hung loose at the neck and a pair of old infantry pants tucked into 
                            wool socks. With the tip of his boot, he scraped through the long grass, pushing 
                            aside dry leaves until he found the rocks hidden underneath. The bushes, once kept 
                            trim by his brothers at his fatherâs behest, had grown wild and tangled, their leafy 
                            branches intertwined, obscuring the graveled path.

                            Michael dropped his bag to the ground and took to the brush on the hill with the 
                            machete. He pushed methodically upwards; sweat dripping from his arms into the 
                            soil. The blade was sharp, and struck quickly through the wood and leaves. He was 
                            halfway up the hill as the sun began to fall beneath the trees on the riverâs opposite 
                            bank. The sunlight flickered and reflected off the windows up above, the glare 
                            reflecting in his eyes. Cutting through the last of the overgrowth, Michael stepped 
                            from the path onto the well-worn wrap-around patio. As he turned towards the 
                            water, the sun finally settled across the shore. The Wolf River grew dark, but the 
                            constant whispering of the current remained.

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            There had once stood a cabin on the land, small but sturdy, almost a hundred years 
                            ago. Now, in its place stood a grand old home, built by Michaelâs grandfather 
                            Marlon after his war. The front of the house was built facing the river, and was 
                            perched precariously over the side of the steep slope where the path led down to the 
                            dock. The porch was dotted with wrought iron benches, where Michael and his 
                            brothers used to sleep on hot summer days. When he was young, their home had 
                            been the pride of the county, but now it was grey and rot with age. Every door had 
                            been bolted shut from the inside, save the one overlooking the lake. Michael laid his
                            bag at his feet and patted down his jacket pockets before finding the iron key hung 
                            on a cord of twine. He had received it in the barracks post in â43, attached with a 
                            form letter from the bank, explaining that the house was his property now. He hadnât 
                            understood until he received the letter from his cousins in Rossville the next day.
                            Though the escutcheon had long since rusted, the lock held true, and the key slid 
                            easily into place. Michael heard the grinding of the unused gears, and pushed the 
                            door unstuck into the living room. No one had set foot in the house in eleven years, 
                            and the floors were choked with dust. As he walked past the fireplace, Michael 
                            dropped his bag on the wide dining table and stepped into the kitchen.

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            He remembered his brother Robert taking him on a walk towards town when they 
                            had been only five and seven years old; they had cut through the wheat field across    
                            the road, and trucked through a shallow pond just north of the Twin Lakes. As they 
                            came down the gentle slope onto the McInnes farm, they had seen the old man and 
                            his wife out in the orchard, and had offered their hands, picking the low hanging 
                            fruit near until sunset. They had left with wide smiles, sore arms and a small hemp 
                            sack of apples given in thanks. Walking back, Robert got the idea to cut the apples 
                            and ask their Ma to bake a pie. When they climbed the steps and walked through the 
                            back door, their father was sitting in his favourite chair smoking from a small <i>bruyere</i> 
                            pipe. The chair was old and worn, but he loved it well, as it had been his fatherâs. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            Their father hardly lifted his head from his book as the boys made way to the kitchen 
                            and Robert drew a long sharp knife from the block. He stepped onto the stool, and 
                            as the pipe smoke floated above their heads, began to slice the apples methodically. 
                            All of a sudden, he hollered like a beast, and the knife slipped from his hand and fell 
                            and stuck in the floor inches from Michaelâs feet. There was blood everywhere, and 
                            the screams woke the baby and Ma yelled from upstairs, but before the panic truly 
                            took hold, their father was there with his clasped iron box. The case was well
                            polished, with silver latches, a thick leather handle and the arms of the U.S Army 
                            emblazoned across its front. It clicked open, and their father removed a small tin 
                            sewing kit and several pads of gauze. He was calm, and his lips were taut under his 
                            thick red beard as he told Michael to hold the gauze to the wound and told their Ma
                            to stay upstairs with the baby. The cut was deep, Michael could see that much, and 
                            the pale white bone of Robertâs thumb was visible halfway between the knuckle and 
                            wrist.
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            His fatherâs hands were steady, never faltering, threading the needle back and forth 
                            through the flesh of his brotherâs hand. Robert was crying, trying to stifle his sobs by 
                            clenching his teeth as the stitches brought sinew and skin together. Their fatherâs 
                            concentration never wavered, his pale green eyes set solely on the task at hand. He 
                            didnât speak other than to ask for gauze or thread, and for a moment, Michael felt as 
                            if he were standing by his fatherâs operating table in town. By the time they were 
                            done, Robertâs tears had dried. Their father reminded them that they were too young 
                            to handle knives, and called down their Ma to dote on the patient. She did, and had 
                            kisses for Michael and Robert both. She had made them throw away the apples, 
                            which had been sprayed with blood, but she promised to buy more.
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            Michael stood and slowly walked towards the basement door in the northwest corner 
                            of the house. As he did, the floorboards moved and creaked beneath him, the dust 
                            jumping and settling with every step. It was then that he heard the howling whistle 
                            through the cracks in the walls, carried adrift over the river from up in the hills. 
                            Quickly, he rushed to the door, and opened it to swallow the sound. It was beautiful, 
                            he thought, to hear as the wolves joined each other from miles away. The moon was 
                            crisp and white, only a sliver away from full, its light hanging soft on the trees like 
                            snow. Every howl was followed by another and as each joined the baleful orchestra 
                            grew stronger. The Nashoba was alive with the night as the moonlight played off its 
                            surface, like a projection in a cinema, with the wolves as a beautiful accompaniment. 
                            Each voice was different than the one before it as they cried out to their brothers and 
                            sisters from miles away. Suddenly, the song began to fade and the voices dropped off 
                            one at a time, as Michael stood silent, shivering from the cold.
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            Stepping back inside, he climbed down the basement stairs and opened the cellar 
                            door. He stood before the large antique cabinet with wound metal handles and 
                            fumbled in his pockets for the key he had found in his fatherâs safety deposit box in 
                            Rossville. It was small and silver and it bore his grandfatherâs initials engraved in 
                            block letters. As he moved to turn the lock the door gently swung open on its own, 
                            revealing the collected armaments of four generations of the King family. That the 
                            door was unlocked was worrisome, but to his relief all the weapons were accounted 
                            for. On the far left was the Enfield rifle laid down by his great-uncle William at the 
                            skirmish at Moscow. Next were his grandfatherâs three hunting rifles, with which 
                            Michael, his brothers and his father were all taught to shoot, firing at cans perched 
                            on a dock out on the river. His uncleâs Lee-Enfield, which his father had bought 
                            back after the Great War, reddened with rust, hung next to a leather holster with his 
                            fatherâs pistol.
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            Their father had first killed a man in the Belleau Wood, though he had rarely spoken 
                            of it. He had been reassigned from his battalion to the Marines, and followed 
                            Sergeant Dalyâs group as a medic on the first charge through the field. Sixteen men 
                            were dead in the blink of an eye as the machine guns tore through their ranks, their 
                            bodies disappearing beneath the waist-high wheat. His father had been lucky, and 
                            had time enough to drop flat to the ground. Crawling on hands and knees, hidden to 
                            the enemy, he could find no sign of life in any of his men as the second wave charged 
                            the enemy encampment. He heard someone shout for a medic from the nearby 
                            wood, and had run to help. The man was an officer, and badly wounded, blood 
                            seeping through the front of his shirt. His father had reached for his kit, but before 
                            he could open it, a shot rang out and the officerâs chest burst open in a splash of 
                            bright red. He turned to see a German soldier advancing slowly, rifle in hand. Their
                            father had always insisted that he had âonly done what was necessaryâ that day, 
                            sparing the details until Michael and his brothers were old enough. He had feigned 
                            surrender, but when the German stepped closer to take his gun, he swept the manâs 
                            legs out from under him. They had wrestled in the mud, tearing at each other 
                            blindly. In the end Michaelâs father had prevailed, and had drawn the Germanâs own 
                            dagger and sunk it in his throat. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            Michael took the pistol, climbed the stairs and stepped through the back door into 
                            the yard behind the house. Even in the dim light, he could make out the trees several 
                            yards away. The woods had seemed infinite when he was a boy, climbing over fallen 
                            trunks and through the thicket at dusk. It was an old oak forest, and the ground was 
                            thick all year round with dried leaves and twigs that crackled underfoot. He had only 
                            ever been lost once in those woods as a young boy, though he had not been scared. It 
                            had been so quiet and peaceful. Robert and Patrick had found him hours later, 
                            sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall birch tree, eyes closed, a smile hanging on 
                            his lips.
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            Michael stuck to the edge of the forest and collected birch bark and kindling. Passing 
                            the old wooden storehouse in the yard, he strode back towards the door of the house. 
                            He lit a match, and lay it gently under the birch in the small stone fireplace until the 
                            bark began to smoke and crisp. Adding the kindling and the logs, the flames spit and 
                            crackled, the heat creeping into Michaelâs bones and bright yellow light flickering
                            throughout the room. Once again, the house felt like home, and Michael could 
                            almost hear his Ma yelling at Patrick to finish his chores or calling the boys down for 
                            dinner. He remembered the sound of Patrickâs shouts when he caught his first trout, 
                            and their fatherâs laughter, and Robert smiling when he got his AGCT results in â39. 
                            He was old now, Michael realized, and his brothers were gone, and here he was on 
                            the old sofa in their house, burning the old wood and staring down at the same old 
                            river. The fire wavered, reflecting in Michaelâs eyes as his eyelids begun to shut. He 
                            felt the day and the night and the day before it in his bones. The heat softly cradled 
                            him against the pillows and he slept, the way a man can only sleep when he feels at 
                            home.
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            The howl carved through the silence and Michael woke with a start. The embers 
                            were fading, and he shivered in the early morning cold. The light filtered through 
                            the trees and dew collected on the windowpane as he rose with the fur blanket 
                            draped around his shoulders. He wiped the sleep from his eyes and walked out onto 
                            the porch into the dawn. He thought it queer that the wolves were howling now, 
                            with the night long since faded into day. The howl sounded again, and reverberated 
                            against the shore, along the river and through the trees, but there was no answer. It 
                            was a lone mournful wail, a pup looking for its pack. Michael turned and stepped 
                            back inside, leaving the door ajar to let the wind whistle in with the fresh country air. 
                            The wolf must have gotten lost. He hoped that its brothers were looking for it.
                        </p>

                        <p class="writing-paragraph">
                            The fireâs embers had turned to charcoal and the house was dark, as the sun had not 
                            yet fully risen from behind the trees on the opposite bank. He opened the first 
                            drawer nearest the back door in the kitchen, and pulled out an old wooden box. 
                            Sitting down at the chair near the window, he set the box on his lap and opened it. 
                            The seat creaked, and the well-worn cushions spat up dust as he settled in. Michael 
                            sat back in his grandfatherâs chair and loaded a single round from the box into the 
                            chamber of his fatherâs pistol, and stared out at the calm waters of the Wolf River as 
                            the sun rose above the trees and the last howl of the lone wolf rang out across the 
                            dawn.
