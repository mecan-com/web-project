Founded in 2014 by Dennis Brotzky and Ronald Yang, L’Écureuil Mort found its namesake when Dennis and Ronald found a dead squirrel out on their terrace. L’Écureuil Mort is a collaborative group of artists and friends who have come together to show our vision of the world. Our team here at L’Écureuil Mort is dedicated to introducing you to the things that inspire and captivate us whether it is through art, photography, literature, or music. In turn, we will also display original content derived from our inspirations. We hope you are inspired too.
